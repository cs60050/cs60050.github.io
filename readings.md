There are no required texts for this course.  In the spirit of Unix, I will generally
only post things that are available for free.  The internet at large contains more
than enough to get you through this course, and beyond.  There are also too many books
to choose from, each of which have their own specialty, flare, and usefulness.

You are not expected to read anything on this page, though I will be putting various
references to supplement what is covered in class as we continue.  They may be helpful
in clarifying, or at the very least give more details than I have covered.

This page will be updated from time to time as the course continues, I will try and
keep related topics in sections.

## Overview / Inspiration

- The [Unix wikipedia page][unix-wiki] has a *huge* amount of information, and more
  history than I could ever provide you with.
- Eric S. Raymond gives an excellent overview of [What Unix Gets Right][gets-right].
  The other sections of his book may not be as informative for you at the beginning
  of this course.

### Other recommendations
  - Cornell's Center for Advanced Computing (CAC) offers a number
    of online training modules, including a good
    [Linux introduction][cac-linux].
  - [GitHub][github] has links to several good resources for
    [learning about Git and GitHub][github-learning].
    I was particularly amused by the interactive [Try Git][try-git]
    tutorial.
  - Atlassian (makers of [BitBucket][bitbucket]) have a good
    [set of Git tutorials as well][bitbucket-turorials].
  - [ProGit][progit] is a freely available online book that
    covers the basics and much more.

  As an aside: [BitBucket][bitbucket] is probably the primary competitor to Git.
  I recommend getting accounts on both GitHub and BitBucket;
  the latter provides unlimited private repositories for educational
  users, which is helpful for managing proposals, paper drafts, and
  other projects that you might want to keep initially private.
