This is the source for the course home page for
[Cornell CS 2043: Unix Tools and Scripting][cs2043].
Course material is written with [Jekyll][jekyll] and deployed on
[GitHub Pages][gh-pages].  Styling is based on
[Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap], and [reveal.js][reveal] is included as
a submodule to support slide presentations.

Contributions are welcome in the form of Pull Requests.

This website was adapted from David Bindel's [CS 5220][cs5220] website,
and was largely just repopulated with the appropriate data.
