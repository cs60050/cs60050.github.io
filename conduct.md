As contributors and maintainers of this class, and in the interest
of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all
people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this class a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of
experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race,
ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or
  electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Course staff have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By
adopting this Code of Conduct, course staff commit themselves
to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect
of managing this class.

This code of conduct applies both within class spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the class or its
community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the
course staff.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.2.0, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/)
